Version Updates

v.0.0.2 - 05/26/18
- mostly done accommodating pianoroll data type
  - model inputs are now pianoroll files (i.e. arrays where nonzero entries are not necessarily 1)
- issue to resolve: output still binary (i.e. probability vector is outputted, with notes sampled from prob vector. How to add velocities to output?)
  - relatedly, what is the best cost to use?

v.0.0.1 - 05/21/18
- changed data_processing to produce pianoroll files without normalizing velocities

v.0.0.0 - 05/21/18
- Forked from brunnergino/JamBot
